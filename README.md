Iâ€™ve successfully created a comprehensive decentralized crowdfunding platform with the following features:

âœ… Core Features Implemented:

Project Creation & Management - Users can create projects with funding goals, deadlines, and custom milestones
Milestone-Based Funding - Smart contract simulation ensures funds are only released when milestones are achieved
Community Voting System - Backers can vote on milestone completion to approve fund releases
Wallet Integration - Simulated Web3 wallet connection with ETH balance management
Dashboard - Complete user dashboard for managing created projects and backed projects
Responsive Design - Modern, mobile-friendly interface with beautiful gradients and animations
ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:

React + TypeScript + Vite for robust development
Shadcn/UI components for polished interface
Local storage simulation of blockchain state
Milestone tracking with voting mechanisms
Fund escrow and release simulation
Project status management (active, funded, completed)
ðŸŽ¨ Design Highlights:

Modern gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism effects
Interactive project cards with progress indicators
Real-time milestone tracking with voting interface
Comprehensive statistics and analytics
Intuitive navigation and user experience
The application demonstrates the core concept of trustless crowdfunding where:

Project creators define milestones with funding percentages
Backers contribute ETH to projects
Funds are held in escrow until milestones are completed
Community votes on milestone completion
Funds are automatically released when milestones are approved
This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

All shadcn/ui components have been downloaded under `@/components/ui`.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - HTML entry point
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration file
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration file
- `package.json` - NPM dependencies and scripts
- `src/app.tsx` - Root component of the project
- `src/main.tsx` - Project entry point
- `src/index.css` - Existing CSS configuration
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Home page logic

## Components

- All shadcn/ui components are pre-downloaded and available at `@/components/ui`
  
## Development

- Import components from `@/components/ui` in your React components
- Customize the UI by modifying the Tailwind configuration

## Note

- The `@/` path alias points to the `src/` directory
- In your typescript code, don't re-export types that you're already importing
